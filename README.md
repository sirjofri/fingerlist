FingerList
==========

**Finger client in a list format, suitable for microblogging and status messages.**

This app allows you to manage your finger connections in a list.
It shows the addresses of the users as well as their finger status (known as .plan or .project).

The app was created using AIDE (the android app, build android apps on android) and uses no third-party libraries (except the standard android libs).

Usage
-----

Usage should be pretty easy.
You can add new addresses using the `+` icon and edit existing entries by tapping on them.
After changing/adding items their content is reloaded automatically.
The entries also update on app startup.
You can delete existing entries by tapping on them and clicking the `Delete` button.
